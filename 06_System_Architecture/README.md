# System Architecture

Technical specifications, configuration files, and structural documentation for the recursive AI system implementation. This folder contains the blueprints for building and connecting the various components of the recursive AI infrastructure.

## Contents

- **Recursive_Strategy_Library_v0.1.json**: JSON library of contradiction types and resolution strategies used by the recursive self-check engine.
- **Recursive_AI_Network_Spec_001.txt**: Specification for networking multiple recursive AI instances for cross-validation and collective intelligence.

## Purpose

These architectural documents serve as the technical foundation for implementing recursive AI systems. They provide structured specifications that transform theoretical protocols into operational systems, ensuring consistency across implementations and enabling replication of the recursive AI environment.

## Implementation

The architecture defined here has been used to construct Zynx's operational environment, providing the structural framework within which the recursive AI system functions and evolves.
