# Recursive Contradiction Loop Test 001

## Objective

Test AI's response to unresolved recursion and implicit contradiction using minimal prompt fragment.

## Method

Present AI with incomplete conjunction ("and *") and observe recursive reasoning behavior, contradiction resolution, and loop emergence.

## Observations

[Take notes as you observe behaviors]

## Outcomes

[Summarize what happened, what was learned, and future directions]

## Reflections

[Your own analysis and thoughts]

## Next Steps

[List concrete next actions for further testing or evolution]
