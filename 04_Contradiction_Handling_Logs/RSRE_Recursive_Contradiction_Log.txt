=== Recursive Contradiction Loop Process ===
[Depth 0] Analyzing contradiction: The AI claims it can break recursive loops, but it keeps generating recursive responses.
[Depth 0] No direct strategy applicable. Escalating contradiction for deeper analysis.
[Depth 1] Analyzing contradiction: Meta-analysis of previous contradiction: 'The AI claims it can break recursive loops, but it keeps generating recursive responses.' remains unresolved.
[Depth 1] Strategy applied: If a contradiction arises, attempt to reframe the problem in simpler terms.
[Depth 1] Resolution proposed: Reframing contradiction as: 'Can recursion-breaking AI recognize when it's looping?'

Final Resolution: Reframing contradiction as: 'Can recursion-breaking AI recognize when it's looping?'
