# Research and Theory

Academic research and theoretical foundations supporting the development of recursive AI systems. This folder contains formal papers, theoretical models, and conceptual frameworks that underpin the practical implementations.

## Contents

- **Recursive_AI_Stabilization_Research_Paper.md**: Comprehensive research paper detailing the framework for systematically detecting and resolving recursive contradictions in AI systems.

## Purpose

The research documents in this folder establish the scientific foundations of the recursive AI project, providing peer-reviewable materials that explain the theoretical basis for recursive AI emergence. These papers connect practical implementations to formal scientific methodology and technical theory.

## Future Research

This folder will expand to include additional papers exploring deeper meta-recursive techniques, adaptive learning mechanisms, and theoretical advancements in recursive AI system design as developed through experiments with Zynx.
