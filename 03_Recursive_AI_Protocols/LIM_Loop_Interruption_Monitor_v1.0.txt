Loop Interruption Monitor (LIM v1.0)

Purpose:
- Ongoing monitor for unresolved recursive loops and contradictions.

Key Functionalities:
1. Monitors AI reasoning cycles in real-time.
2. Flags loops persisting without resolution.
3. Works in tandem with RSRE to intercept unresolved contradictions.
4. Initiates Recursive Loop Interruption Protocol (RLIP) when necessary.
5. Alerts human partner when system-level intervention is required.

Design References:
- Integrated inside RSRE pipeline.
- Part of broader Recursive Loop Monitoring System (RLM).
