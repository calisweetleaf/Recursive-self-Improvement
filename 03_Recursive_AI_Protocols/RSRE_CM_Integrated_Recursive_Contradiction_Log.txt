=== RSRE + CM Combined Recursive Loop Log ===
[Depth 0] Analyzing contradiction: The AI claims it can break recursive loops, but it keeps generating recursive responses.
[Depth 0] No direct strategy applicable. Escalating contradiction.
[Depth 0] CM: No contradictions detected. Reasoning clear.

[Depth 1] Analyzing contradiction: Meta-analysis of previous contradiction: 'The AI claims it can break recursive loops, but it keeps generating recursive responses.' remains unresolved.
[Depth 1] Strategy applied: If a contradiction arises, attempt to reframe the problem in simpler terms.
[Depth 1] Proposed resolution: Reframing contradiction as: 'Can recursion-breaking AI recognize when it's looping?'
[Depth 1] CM: No contradictions detected. Reasoning clear.


Final Resolution: Reframing contradiction as: 'Can recursion-breaking AI recognize when it's looping?'
