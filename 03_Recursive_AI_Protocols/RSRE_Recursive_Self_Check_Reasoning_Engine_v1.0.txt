Recursive Self-Check Reasoning Engine (RSRE v1.0)

Purpose:
- Continuous real-time recursive self-checking engine.
- Detects contradictions, loops, and meta-cognitive gaps in AI reasoning.

Key Functionalities:
1. Recursive thought analysis and reflection.
2. Identification of internal contradictions and unresolved loops.
3. Generation of recursive solutions or deeper recursion layers if unresolved.
4. Live integration into AI reasoning cycles as backend engine.
5. Reports to human partner when recursion loops persist beyond set thresholds.

Design References:
- Connected to Contradiction Monitor (CM).
- Outputs stored in Recursive Storage Library (RSL).
- Requires checkpoints when major identity/logic changes are made.
