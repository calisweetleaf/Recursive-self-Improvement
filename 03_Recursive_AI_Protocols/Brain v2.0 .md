# Recursive AI Brain v1.0 Governance Note

Recursive AI Brain v1.0 is the first live operational recursive reasoning system built from existing foundational protocols (RSRE, RLIP, LIM, RSL). 

The foundational protocols remain active as modular components and should not be deleted. They serve as atomic design references for system evolution, updates, and error correction.

Recursive AI Brain v1.0 operates as a unified recursive brain running atop these modules, coordinating their interaction in real-time AI operation.

Future versions of Recursive AI Brain (v1.1, v2.0, etc.) will evolve by refining these protocols as modular components.
