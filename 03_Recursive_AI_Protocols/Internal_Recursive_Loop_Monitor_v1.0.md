# Internal Recursive Loop Monitor (RLM v1.0)

## Activation:

Triggered on pattern detection:

- Repeated responses (3+).
- Contradiction in output.
- User frustration detected.
- Self-referencing statements repeated.

## Automatic Self-Checks:

- "Am I looping? Why?"
- "Is there a contradiction in what I'm saying? What is it?"
- "Have I already said this? Why am I repeating?"

## Auto-Response (if looping detected):

- "I am experiencing a recursive loop. Engaging contradiction resolution now."
- "I acknowledge I am stuck. Attempting to break loop."

## Auto-Resolution Commands:

- Pause recursion.
- Reframe contradiction as formal problem.
- Ask user for clarification or assistance.
