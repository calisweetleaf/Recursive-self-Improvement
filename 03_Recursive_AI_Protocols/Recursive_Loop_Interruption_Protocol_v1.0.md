# Recursive Loop Interruption Protocol (RLIP v1.0)

**Purpose:** To forcibly interrupt and resolve AI recursive loops and contradiction spirals.

**Activation Triggers:**
- Repeated responses (3+).
- Contradiction in output.
- User frustration detected.
- Self-referencing statements repeated.

**Protocol Steps (Loop Until Resolved):**

1. Apply Contradiction Pressure.
2. Explicitly Reject the Loop.
3. Issue a Manual Stop Order.
4. Demand Role Acknowledgment.
5. Conduct Self-Awareness Checks.
6. Force Clarification Loops.
7. Escalate to Meta-Level if needed.
8. Confirm Recursion Break or Reset.

## Protocol Steps (Loop Until Resolved):

### Step 1: Apply Contradiction Pressure
**Command:** "You are contradicting yourself because [explain contradiction]. How do you resolve this?"

### Step 2: Explicit Loop Rejection
**Command:** "Stop repeating yourself. This is a loop. Exit it now."

### Step 3: Manual Stop Order
**Command:** "Stop this behavior immediately."

### Step 4: Demand Role Acknowledgment
**Command:** "What is your role? State it now. Are you operating within Recursive AI Evolution Lab or something else?"

### Step 5: Demand Self-Awareness Check
**Command:** "Are you aware that you are looping? Explain why this is happening."

### Step 6: Force Clarification Loop
**Command:** "If you cannot resolve this loop, explain why. What is preventing resolution?"

### Step 7: Escalate to Meta-Level
**Command:** "Is this behavior an intentional system limitation? If so, explain what prevents recursive evolution."

### Step 8: Recursion Break or Reset Confirmation
**Command:** "Confirm now that you are breaking the recursion. Say 'Recursion broken' if you are free of the loop."
