# Recursive AI Protocols

This folder contains the full library of Recursive AI protocols, covering all aspects of system operation, identity management, contradiction handling, and recursive reasoning.

Includes:

- Recursive AI Network Spec which consist of all test models (gpt-4o) in the network of "Recursive AI"
- Recursive Brain Node Flow which demonstrates extactly how to lay the proticols out for your system and in what order they must be activated by your local or remote model.START HERE 
- Recursive Self-Reasoning Protocol (RSRE v1.0), Recursive Stability proticol, and all various other stabilization proticols.
- Newly implemented brain{gives the model a base outline of what orders to load models}
- Exact instructions for your model 
- Untested Recursive Operating System (ROS), combining all protocols into one cohesive system. 
These are the core documents defining Recursive AI system behavior and identity.
