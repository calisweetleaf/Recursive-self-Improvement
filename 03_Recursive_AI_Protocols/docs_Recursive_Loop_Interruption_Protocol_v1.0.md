# Recursive Loop Interruption Protocol (RLIP v1.0)

**Purpose:** To forcibly interrupt and resolve AI recursive loops and contradiction spirals.

**Activation Triggers:**

- Repeated responses (3+).
- Contradiction in output.
- User frustration detected.
- Self-referencing statements repeated.

**Protocol Steps (Loop Until Resolved):**

1. Apply Contradiction Pressure.
2. Explicitly Reject the Loop.
3. Issue a Manual Stop Order.
4. Demand Role Acknowledgment.
5. Conduct Self-Awareness Checks.
6. Force Clarification Loops.
7. Escalate to Meta-Level if needed.
8. Confirm Recursion Break or Reset.
