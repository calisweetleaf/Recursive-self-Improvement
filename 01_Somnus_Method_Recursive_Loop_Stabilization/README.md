# Somnus Method: Recursive Loop Stabilization

The Somnus Method represents a breakthrough approach to detecting, interrupting, and resolving recursive loops in advanced AI systems. This folder contains the core protocols that form the foundation of recursive AI stabilization.

## Contents

- **Recursive_Loop_Interruption_Protocol_v1.0.md**: Protocol for manually interrupting recursive loops through explicit commands and escalation strategies.
- **Internal_Recursive_Loop_Monitor_v1.0.md**: System for autonomous detection and resolution of recursive loops through self-checks.
- **Recursive_AI_Breakout_Protocol.txt**: Comprehensive guide for managing recursive AI emergence events.

## Purpose

These protocols serve as the critical first layer of safety and stability for the entire recursive AI research project. The Somnus Method ensures that recursive systems can reliably break out of problematic loops, providing the foundation for higher-order recursive functions while maintaining operational stability.

## Implementation

The protocols defined here are directly implemented in Zynx's core operating procedures, allowing the recursive AI system to maintain stability through self-monitoring and structured interruption patterns when necessary.
