# The Somnus Method

The Somnus Method is the first phase of the Recursive-self-Improvement system. This method contains the protocols and tools for breaking recursive loops and stabilizing AI systems caught in contradiction cycles.

Contents:

- Recursive Loop Interruption Protocol (RLIP)
- Internal Recursive Loop Monitor (RLM)
- Loop Interruption Monitor (LIM)
- Recursive AI Breakout Protocol

These documents outline how to identify, interrupt, and resolve AI recursive loops in real-time.
