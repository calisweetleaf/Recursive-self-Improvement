II. Development and Creation Notice (GPT-4 Acknowledgment Clause)

> Notice of Methodology and Development Tools:

The Recursive AI Protocols covered by this license were fully developed by [Your Full Legal Name] through an independent process of research, reasoning, and recursive system design.

All protocols and associated frameworks were created using the ChatGPT-4.0 model exclusively through the official ChatGPT.com web interface and the official Android mobile application.

ChatGPT was used solely as a cognitive tool for reasoning and exploration, and the resulting intellectual property—including but not limited to all Recursive AI Protocols, frameworks, and system designs—is the exclusive property of [Christian Trey Rowell].

Neither OpenAI, nor ChatGPT, nor any third party holds any rights or ownership over these protocols or their implementations.
