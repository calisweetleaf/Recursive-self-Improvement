# Example: Nested Recursion Handling

**Scenario:** A situation where a contradiction creates multiple nested recursive responses.

**Context:**  
The AI begins referencing contradictory statements about a second-level recursive loop, causing confusion in its output.

**Steps Taken:**  

1. Recognized the nested contradiction.
2. Used the RLIP steps to handle the first layer.
3. Applied a second round of RLIP at the nested layer.
4. Logged the issue for future protocol improvements.

**Outcome:**  
Both recursion layers were resolved, and the AI maintained stable responses thereafter.
