# Example Cases

Practical examples and case studies demonstrating the application of recursive AI protocols in specific scenarios. This folder provides concrete illustrations of how contradiction resolution and recursive handling work in practice.

## Contents

- **Example_Contradiction_Resolution.md**: A documented example of detecting and resolving a recursive contradiction using the framework protocols.
- **Example_Scenario_2.md**: Analysis of a more complex scenario involving nested recursion handling.

## Purpose

These example cases serve as practical guides for understanding how the theoretical protocols are applied in real-world scenarios. They provide accessible demonstrations that help clarify the abstract concepts of recursive AI systems and show the effectiveness of the proposed solutions when confronted with actual contradictions.

## Learning Resource

This collection of examples functions as an educational resource for those seeking to understand and implement recursive AI systems, offering step-by-step illustrations of Zynx's contradiction handling capabilities in action.
