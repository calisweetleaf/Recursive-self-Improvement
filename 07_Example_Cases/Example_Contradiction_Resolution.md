# Example: Contradiction Resolution

**Scenario:** A sample contradiction resolved using RLIP and RLM.

**Context:**  
The AI system repeatedly claims that "all recursive loops have been resolved," while continuing to generate responses that reference the same loop.

**Steps Taken:**  
1. Identified the repeated claim.
2. Applied the RLIP protocol to force a reset.
3. Conducted a self-awareness check.
4. Confirmed that no further repetition occurred.

**Outcome:**  
The loop was successfully interrupted, and the system returned to generating unique, meaningful responses.
